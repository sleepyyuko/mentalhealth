<h4> This should be the question you're fascinated with! </h4>

<h3> What effects can we see from our mental health deterroriating? </h3>

<p> As our mental health deterriorates, people could be seen doing harrasful behaviours due to the sudden outburst of negativity.</p>

<p> When mental health gets worse, you might feel sad, anxious, or angry more often. It can be hard to focus, and you may have negative thoughts. You might avoid people, lose interest in things you enjoy, and notice changes in sleep, appetite, or energy. Relationships and work can also be affected.</p>

<p> There can also be more mood changes which can affect our personalities when we talk to people giving off different impressions. Aside from that, more and more suicidal thoughts could occur due to the lack of enjoyment in life.</p>

<p> It is said that your environment is the key to future, so if you are having difficult times, it might just be your environment.</p>
