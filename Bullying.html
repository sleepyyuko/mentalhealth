 			<h2> Psychological Abuse</h2>

 		<p> If you're getting bullied, some actions like exclusion, gossiping, humiliation or even intimidation could harm the mentality of the victim. Most of the time, the victims who get affected by these actions end up killing themselves due to the trauma. Additionally, those who suffered from these acts tend to develop mental disorders for example like anxiety or depression. They also try to isolate themselves from the outside world as they have already suffered too much making it hard for them to even get contact with people that want to help the victim.
