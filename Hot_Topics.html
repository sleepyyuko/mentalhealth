<h3> What are some causes that impact our mental health? </h3>

<p> As this website disccuses, some causes may be because of Irrational behaviour, the pressure exceeded from education or even just by scrolling through social media. But fundamentally, our environment is the true cause. If we are with people that would abuse us, spread negative things about us or even exclude us from events, this could hurt our mentality. Additionally, physical pain can cause trauma which can induce our psychological mind to be at a state of scardness. Even the act of stress, anxiety or other emotions that can cause an overwhelming amount of problems to our mind. Thus, there are many ways for us to experience an impact on our mental health which means we should always be cautious not to suck up any of these ill intentions. </p>

<p> Children might face many mental health problems relating with either their parents or even from education. As parents, it is no doubt that their duty is to protect their offspring. But, if they use any voilent actions or words, this could potentially hurt or put a scar on their mental health. </p>

<p> Teenagers might face various mental health problems mainly from the stress of education due to the amount of tasks and exams they would give in which we simply cannot handle. This could cause many irrational actions for the youth to do due to these unrealistic expectations also sent on them from other people. </p>

<p> Adults and Elders might face mental health problems purely from their age and the joyous memories of their younger times. Everyone seeks to be young yet time flies by. Additionally, usages of drugs could also affect their mental health. </p>

<p> Some psychological problems might also be caused by genetic factors like psychopathy or ADHD(Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) . So, you shouldn't always blame people for acting how they are. They have a chance of being disabled. </p>
